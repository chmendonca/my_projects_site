            <h3>About me:</h3>
            <p>I'm a Mechatronic Engineer (2001) and Master in Aeronautical Engineer (2004). I have worked on
                aeronautical
                industry since 2003 as "System Integration Test Engineer". Nowadays, I have worked with system
                integration
                tests on RIG with main focus on engine and its controller (FADEC). I'm very experienced on software test
                on
                simulated environment with real controllers/components (HIL) to validate and to verify how the system
                and
                its interfaces would behave in normal, failed and out of envelope conditions. These activities demmand
                wide
                knowlodge on <span style="font-weight: bold;">"ARP4754"</span> and <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">"System
                    Engineer"</span> directrices.</p>
            <p>This field of work makes me present on the aircraft entire lifecycle, from initial definition, Type
                Certification, entry-into-service and fleet support.</p>
            <h3>About this site:</h3>
            <p>My intention is to have a place to store and share my developments and knowledge.</p>
            <p>I have scripted for a long time and I've tryed different languages but I'm confident using <a
                    href="mainPython.html">Python</a> (2.7 and 3) that I've used on my daily work (creating scripts for
                test
                automation and
                test analysis) and my personal stuffs since 2008.</p>
            <p>During the quarentine, forced by COVID-19 (a few months on 2020), I decided to improve my <a
                    href="mainPython.html">Python</a> skills besides of adding the <a href="mainJava.html">Java</a> and
                the
                set <a href="mainHtml5Css3.html">HTML5/CSS3</a> to my portfolio.</p>
