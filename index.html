    <p>This is my personal site with my developments that have been done during my studies and my own needs to solve any
        problem.</p>

    <p>About me:</p>
    <p>I'm a Mechatronic Engineer (2001) and Master in Aeronautical Engineer (2004).
        I have worked on aeronautical industry since 2003 as "System Integration Test Engineer". Nowadays my field of
        work is engine and its controller (FADEC) integration tests on RIGs. I'm very experienced on software test on
        simulated environment with real components (HIL) to validate and to verify how the system and its interfaces
        would behave in normal, failed and out of envelope conditions. These activities demmand wide knowlodge on
        <b>"ARP4754"</b> and <b>"System Engineer"</b> concepts.</p>
    <p>This field of work makes me present on the aircraft entire lifecycle, from initial definition, Type
        certification, entry-into-service and fleet support.</p>

    <p>On this site, my intention is to have a place to store and share my developments and knowlodge on the
        computational field.</p>

    <p>I have scripted for a long time and I've tryed different languages but I'm confident using <a
            href="mainPython.html">Python</a> (2.7 and 3)
        that I've used on my work (creating scripts for test automation and test analysis) and my personal stuffs since
        2008.</p>

    <p>During the quarentine, forced by COVID-19 (a few months on 2020), I decided to improve my <a
            href="mainPython.html">Python</a> skills besides
        of adding the <a href="mainJava.html">Java</a> and the set <a href="mainHtml5Css3JS.html">HTML5/CSS3</a> to my
        portfolio.</p>
