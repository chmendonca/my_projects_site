                <p id="about">About me:</p>
                <p>I'm a Mechatronic Engineer (2001) and Master in Aeronautical Engineer (2004). I have worked on aeronautical industry since 2003 as "System Integration Test Engineer". Nowadays, I have worked with system integration tests on RIG with main focus on engine and its controller (FADEC). I'm very experienced on software test on simulated environment with real controllers/components (HIL) to validate and to verify how the system and its interfaces would behave in normal, failed and out of envelope conditions. These activities demmand wide knowlodge on <b>"ARP4754"</b> and <b>"System Engineer"</b> concepts.</p>
                <p>This field of work makes me present on the aircraft entire lifecycle, from initial definition, Type Certification, entry-into-service and fleet support.</p>

                <p id="about">About this site:</p>
                <p>My intention is to have a place to store and share my developments and knowlodge on the software languages and work (obviously sharing only non-restricted information).</p>
                <p>I have scripted for a long time and I've tryed different languages but I'm confident using <a href="mainPython.html">Python</a> (2.7 and 3) that I've used on my daily work (creating scripts for test automation and test analysis) and my personal stuffs since 2008.</p>
                <p>During the quarentine, forced by COVID-19 (a few months on 2020), I decided to improve my <a href="mainPython.html">Python</a> skills besides of adding the <a href="mainJava.html">Java</a> and the set <a href="mainhtml5css3.html">HTML5/CSS3</a> to my portfolio.</p>
