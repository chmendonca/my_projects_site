            This part of the page is dedicated to describe the pitfalls I have found during my own developments. My intention has been to make a "help" of problems and how to solve or make a workaround on them (at least one way to solve).
            For me it has been very important, mainly in these languages, because they don't return error messages, they only don't work properly.
